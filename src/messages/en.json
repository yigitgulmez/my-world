From naming variables to understanding when and how to validate data, I gained valuable experience.\n\nIn the beginning, even the simplest things would take me hours. Especially because of my obsession with details, I rewrote my CSS codes countless times, and even when I didn’t know how to write the most basic code, I was trying to write the best one. But every obstacle helped me move one step further.\n\nThis project isn’t just a completed task for me; it’s a reference point I can look back on and say, “This is where I started.” After all, my main goal was to leave a mark and grow through the process — and I think I’ve achieved that."
